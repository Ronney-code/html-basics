      a circuit on or off, allowing users to 
      control the flow of electricity in a 
      device by essentially "making" or "breaking" 
      an electrical connection, commonly seen 
      in everyday applications like turning on lights,
       appliances, or controlling machinery in 
       industrial settings. </td>
